# Call for Papers

## High Quality Practical Content

Our planning process starts with great quality content, we carefully select topics that our attendees can go right back to work and start adopting. Those topics are laid out [below](#topics) and messaged to our attendees on our website well before announcing speakers, we then find amazing speakers to talk in those spots. This is a lot different than the traditional CFP process.

Don't see a topic you can speak to below? Don't worry submit any way! We read every submission and if you can convince us, we will pursue it further to ensure that it is ready for our primarily startup and enterprise focused attendees, who are looking for talks that they can go back to work with knowledge of how to implement into existing systems, over something that would require them to start a project in a new stack.

### Diversity & Inclusion

We want an event that everyone can be proud of. Part of our mission is to support speakers coming from typically underrepresented demographics, so we encourage you to submit and share with your network so we have a large and diverse submission pool to select from. We want to ensure we have an inclusive event, for this reason, **you will be required to legally bind yourself to our code of conduct in our contract process**, and we will investigate you as a speaker to ensure we see the quality and exemplary behavior.

### Content

None of the content should be beginner level, our focus is on professional development, anything at a beginner level will only be considered for [Workshops](./workshops.md). Your sessions should clearly outline what the attendee will learn, why it is important, and how it relates to a professional environment.

You will be required to submit your slides ahead of time to ensure you a quality thought out presentation and for our mobile app to have slides for the attendees to follow along too as the rooms are quite large.

### What to expect from us

We accept submissions on a rolling basis, if your session and profile match what we have decided are must haves you will receive a contract from us, then be published on the site, then receive your ticket which has discounts for booking flights and hotels. You are in charge of booking your travel and arriving prepared, we will reimburse those being paid after the event.

If you haven't heard from us, that doesn't mean it's a no from us, it's just a not right now. Since we curate things a bit differently we slot in a few things in advanced, to help with marketing, then supplement them with complimentary talks. There are also some topics that we simply can't decide on until closer to the event because they might not be relevant any more.

Once our schedule is filled up you will hear from us regardless, this should not be later than July 31st.
