# Call for Papers

## High Quality Practical Content

Our planning process starts with looking for high quality content. Our CFP process is a little non-traditional: we carefully select topics that our attendees can absorb and begin adopting at work immediately. Those topics are laid out [below](#topics), and they are messaged to our attendees on our website well before announcing speakers. we then work with our community to find amazing speakers to talk in those spots.

Don't see a topic you feel comfortable speaking about? No worries, submit anyway! We read **every submission** and if you can convince us, we will pursue it further to ensure that it is ready for our primarily startup and enterprise focused attendees.

### Diversity & Inclusion

We want an event that everyone can be proud of. Part of our mission is to support speakers coming from typically underrepresented demographics, so we encourage you to submit and share with your network so we have a large and diverse submission pool to select from. We want to ensure we have an inclusive event, for this reason, **you will be required to legally bind yourself to our code of conduct in our contract process**, and we will investigate you as a speaker to ensure we see the quality and exemplary behaviour.

### Content

None of the content should be beginner level, our focus is on professional development, anything at a beginner level will only be considered for [Workshops](./workshops.md). Your sessions should clearly outline what the attendee will learn, why it is important, and how it relates to a professional environment.

You will be required to submit your slides ahead of time to ensure you a quality thought out presentation and for our mobile app to have slides for the attendees to follow along too as the rooms are quite large.

### What to expect from us

We accept submissions on a rolling basis, if your session and profile match what we have decided are must haves you will receive a contract from us, be published on the site, then receive your conference ticket which has discounts for booking  both flights and hotels. You are in charge of booking your travel and arriving prepared, and should you be eligible for reimbursement we will do so following the event.

If you haven't heard from us after submitting, be patient! If you don't receive word before July 31st that doesn't mean it's a no from us, it's just a not right now. We spend time curating content a bit differently: we first slot in a few killer topics likely to excite the community and get them curious in advance to help with marketing, then we supplement these topics with complementary talks. There are also some topics that we simply can't decide on until closer to the event due to the evolving state of the industry: relevance can change quickly.

Once our schedule is filled up you will hear from us regardless, this should not be later than July 31st.
