## Compensation Policy

[TechMasters](./techmasters.md) is a non-profit, all of the funds we raise go into putting on our events, this includes covering travel and lodging. We can not offer payment for speaking services. Travel and Lodging will be done on a reimbursement basis following the event using the below pay structure based on regions. We can not pay all of our speakers, so if your employer can sponsor you, we will give them free advertising on our site. All reimbursement will be in Canadian dollars and we will not reimburse for banking or PayPal fees please take note of this for international submissions.

Original Content is preferred, for this reason when you select that you would like to be reimbursed you will be placed into a lottery if you have given this talk you are submitting at another major conference. Having practiced it at a meetup or your office is completely fine, but it is hard for a non-profit event to compete when the content has already made its way around the circuit.

We understand that making a presentation is a lot of work and that not getting paid for that time can suck, however, we have found that this process weeds out anyone that is just speaking for the publicity, to pitch ideas, or doesn’t value the grassroots sharing that makes our events unique. We have a non-commercial policy in the code of conduct you can not advertise products, services, or your employer during your presentation, our attendees are here to learn about your content.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [contact us](./contact.md)
