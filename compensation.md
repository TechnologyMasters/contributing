## Compensation Policy

[TechMasters](./techmasters.md) is a non-profit entity.

As such, all of the funds we raise go directly into putting on our events. This includes covering travel and lodging. However, we can not offer payment for speaking services. Travel and lodging will reimbursed on a first-come first-served basis (except where outlined below) following the event according to the structure below, adjusted per region of origin. Due to the non-profit nature of the entity and events, we can not guarantee reimbursement for all speakers, so if your employer can sponsor you, we are happy to provide free advertising on our website. All reimbursement will be in Canadian dollars and we will not reimburse for banking or PayPal fees. Please take note of this for international submissions.

**Original content** is preferred, if you have submitted content that has been presented at one or more other major conferences, your reimbursement eligibility will be lottery-based. Having practiced it at a meetup or your office is completely fine, but we ask for your understanding in this matter: it is difficult for a non-profit event to compete when the content has already made its way around the circuit.

We know and appreciate that making a presentation is a lot of work. We're very grateful for any and all submissions and the hours of work associated with each. Over time and years of events across spanning both different types of people and technologies we have found that this process selects more strongly for the quality, community-enabling content that makes our events unique. We have a non-commercial policy in the code of conduct: this conference is not a forum for advertisement, and any products and services you speak about should be contextualized towards the value they're creating for developers and the community - no sales pitches allowed.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to [contact us](./contact.md)
