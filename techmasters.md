## About

[TechMasters][website] is an An online community tying together a diverse and passionate group of developers, technologists, and entrepreneurs from all around the world

TechMasters was created in late 2014 as a place where a bunch of friends and co-workers from the Toronto tech scene would come together and share technology news, lessons learned, and help each other debug problems. Since then, after opening its doors to the worldwide developer and tech community, the group has grown to over 6,000+ members!

The group today focuses on learning, and sharing experiences across business, technology, and entrepreneurship, and touting strong community ties with local organizations acting as the official online community for [DevTO](http://www.devto.), [FullStack Toronto](https://www.fsto.co) and others.
